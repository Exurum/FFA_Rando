# FFA-Randomizer

Preface: This is my first coding project and it will probably be a little bumpy.

The goal of this project is to randomize the Game Boy game Final Fantays Adventure also known as Seiken Densetsu in Japan. It was the first game in the mana series. The changes in this code will likely produce a result that looks very disimilar to the original game.

Steps will need to be taken to make the game randomizer compatible.

It is suggested to play the original game first or at least familiarize yourself with the game before playing the randomizer.
